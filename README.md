# TO-DO-LIST
his is a modern, responsive, and feature-rich To-Do web application designed to help you organize your tasks efficiently. Built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app provides a clean, mobile-first user interface with intuitive features and subtle animations for an enhanced user experience.

1. Key Features

2. App-like UI: 
The interface is designed to mimic a native mobile application, featuring a prominent top bar, a sliding side menu, and a scrollable main content area.

3. Persistent Storage:
All tasks are automatically saved to your browser's localStorage. Your to-do list will remain exactly as you left it, even if you close the browser tab.

4. Dynamic Task Organization: 
Tasks are automatically sorted and grouped into smart categories to help you prioritize your day:

5. Overdue: 
Tasks with a past deadline are highlighted for immediate attention.
Today, Tomorrow, This Week: Tasks are dynamically sorted based on their upcoming deadlines.

6.Later: 
Tasks with no set deadline or a long-term deadline are placed in a separate category.

7. Customizable Tasks:
Users can add tasks with specific details:

9. Task Description: 
A simple text field for entering the task.

10. Deadline:
A date and time picker to set a precise deadline for each task.

11. Lists: 
Tasks can be assigned to different lists (e.g., Personal, Work, Shopping) to keep your to-dos separate and organized.

Interactive Task Management:

Checklist Mode: Select multiple tasks at once to perform bulk actions like deleting or sharing. A task counter in the header updates as you select items.

Animated Interactions: Adding, completing, and deleting tasks are accompanied by smooth animations, providing satisfying visual feedback.

Deadline Notifications: The app includes a custom, non-intrusive pop-up notification system. When a task's deadline is within 10 minutes, a notification will appear to remind you, helping you stay on track.
